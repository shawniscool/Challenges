#Challenges
This is a project for [HackPSU](http://www.hackpsu.org/) and I partnered with Henry Lee in creating a web platform that allows people to set challenges together and utilize money/point as their motivation to complete their tasks. For instance, close friends could set goals together and monitor each other's progress. Our platform allows facebook login feature and will have venmo functionality so that the app is dedicated to serving friends.
